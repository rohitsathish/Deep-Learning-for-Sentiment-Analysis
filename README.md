# Deep-Learning-for-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I built a deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/), a social network for investors and traders. My model is able to predict whether a particular message is positive or negative. From this, I generated a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
